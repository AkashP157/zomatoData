It'll make you lose your mind.\"  \r\n\r\nThe story of the blues, is the history of African Americans told through the story of their most popular music. It is the story of the cultural present finding inspiration in the cultural past. But perhaps most fundamentally, the story of the blues is one of American race relations, a document of struggle and conflict on the one hand, but also a suggestion of something universally human that just might point the way toward a future more premised on understanding and cooperation. And the world is almost always in need of more understanding and cooperation.  \r\n\r\nIn that spirit, we would like to present some of the earliest blues recordings by artists like Robert Johnson, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Blake, Rev. Gary Davis and others.  \r\n\r\nVader and Ray have been playing the guitar for a while now. They seem to really enjoy it. They mostly play the blues.
